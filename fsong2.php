All day <br> <br>

Staring at the ceiling making <br> <br>

Friends with shadows on my wall <br> <br>

All night <br> <br> 
&nbspA        &nbsp  &nbsp  F#m <br> <br> 
I'm hearing voices telling me <br> <br> 
&nbsp  &nbspD <br> <br> 
That i should get some sleep <br> <br> 
&nbsp  &nbsp      E <br> <br> 
Because tomorrow might be good for something <br> <br>
