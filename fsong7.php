        Am <br> 
I see your monsters <br> <br>
    F  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
I see your pain  <br> <br>
    C  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp<br> 
Tell me your problems  <br> <br>

Am   &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp     F <br> 
In the dark we we  <br> <br>

We stand apart we we <br> <br>
&nbsp G                 &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp                         Am <br>
Never see that the things that we need are staring right at us <br> <br>

You just want to hide hide <br> <br>
                C <br>
Hide never show your smile smile <br> <br>

Stand alone when you need someone it’s the hardest thing of all <br> <br>
                F <br> 
That you see are the bad bad  <br> <br>
C  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br> 
Bad memories take your time and you’ll find me <br> <br>
