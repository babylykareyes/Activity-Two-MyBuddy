<br>
&nbspG  &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp         Am <br> <br> 
Lift your head, baby, don't be scared <br> <br> 
&nbspBm               &nbsp  &nbsp                &nbsp  &nbsp    Am - D <br> <br> 
Of the things that could go wrong along the way <br> <br> 
&nbspG &nbsp  &nbsp        Am &nbsp<br> <br> 
You'll get by with a smile <br> <br> 
&nbspBm   &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp         Am - D&nbsp  <br> <br> 
You can't win at everything but you can try <br> <br> 
<br> <br> 
[Chorus] <br> <br> 
&nbspBb <br> <br> 
Baby, you don't have to worry <br> <br> 
&nbspEb <br> <br> 
'Coz there ain't no need to hurry <br> <br> 
&nbspBb   &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp          Eb&nbsp  <br> <br> 
No one ever said that there's an easy way <br> <br> 
&nbsp  &nbspBb <br> <br> 
When they're closing all their doors <br> <br> 
&nbsp  &nbspEb <br> <br> 
And they don't want you anymore <br> <br> 
&nbsp  &nbsp  Bb   &nbsp  &nbsp     &nbsp  &nbsp               D&nbsp <br> <br> 
This sounds funny but I'll say it anyway <br> <br> 
<br> <br> 
<br>
[Verse] <br> <br> 
&nbsp G    &nbsp  &nbsp             Am &nbsp  &nbsp <br> <br> 
Girl, I'll stay through the bad  times <br> <br> 
&nbspBm   &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp  Am - D &nbsp<br> <br> 
Even if I have to fetch you every day <br> <br> 
&nbspG &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp         Am <br> <br> 
I'll get by if you smile <br> <br> 
&nbspBm&nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp          Am - D&nbsp <br> <br> 
You can never be too happy in this life <br> <br> 
<br> <br> 
[Chorus] <br> <br> 
&nbspBb <br> <br> 
In a world where everybody <br> <br> 
&nbspEb <br> <br> 
Hates a happy ending story <br> <br> 
&nbspBb   &nbsp  &nbsp  &nbsp  &nbsp            D - E &nbsp  &nbsp <br> <br> 
It's a wonder love can make this world go 'round <br> <br> 
&nbspBb <br> <br> 
And don't let it bring you down <br> <br> 
&nbsp Eb <br> <br> 
And turn your face into a frown <br> <br> 
&nbsp  &nbsp Bb  &nbsp  &nbsp  &nbsp  &nbsp           D &nbsp<br> <br> 
You'll get along with a little prayer and a song <br> <br> 
<br>
<br>
[Bridge] <br> <br> 
G - Am - Bm -Am - D <br> <br>  
(To doo doo doo...) <br> <br> 
Let me hear you sing it<br> <br> 
G - Am - Bm -Am - D <br> <br> 
(To doo doo doo...) <br> <br> 
<br> <br> 
[Chorus] <br>  <br> 
&nbspBb <br> <br> 
In a world where everybody <br> <br> 
&nbsp  &nbsp Eb <br> <br> 
Hates a happy ending story <br> <br> 
&nbsp  &nbsp Bb                   &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp  D - E &nbsp<br> <br> 
It's a wonder love can make the world go 'round <br> <br> 
&nbspBb <br> <br> 
But don't let it bring you down <br> <br> 
&nbsp  &nbsp Eb <br> <br> 
And turn your face into a frown <br> <br> 
&nbsp  &nbsp Bb          &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp      D &nbsp <br> <br> 
You'll get along with a little prayer and a song <br> <br> 
<br>
[Verse] (Riff 1 is played over this verse) <br> <br> 
&nbsp G  &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp         Am <br> <br> 
Lift your head, baby, don't be scared <br> <br> 
&nbspBm               &nbsp  &nbsp          Am - D <br> <br> 
Of the things that could go wrong along the way <br> <br> 
&nbspG    &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp              Am <br> <br> 
You'll get by with a smile <br> <br> 
&nbspBm                    &nbsp  &nbsp   Am - D <br> <br> 
Now it's time to kiss away those tears goodbye <br> <br>
