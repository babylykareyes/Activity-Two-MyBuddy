I've been passing time watching trains go by <br> <br>
&nbsp  &nbspD  &nbsp  &nbsp      &nbsp  &nbsp     G <br> <br>
All of my life <br> <br>
&nbsp    G/B   &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp                  C <br> <br>
Lying on the sand, watching seabirds fly <br> <br>
&nbspA     &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp    G &nbsp  &nbsp<br> <br>
Wishing there would be <br> <br>
B7      &nbsp  &nbsp        Em   &nbsp  &nbsp      A   &nbsp  &nbsp  <br>     <br>
Someone waiting home for me <br>

Looking back as lovers go walking past <br> <br>

&nbsp  &nbsp       G/B   &nbsp  &nbsp            &nbsp  &nbsp     C &nbsp  &nbsp<br> <br>
Wondering how they met and what makes it last <br> <br>
&nbspA &nbsp  &nbsp    G <br> <br>
If I found the place <br> <br>
&nbsp B7   &nbsp  &nbsp   Em      &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp           A <br> <br>

So many dreams to wake <br> <br>

&nbsp  &nbspA &nbsp  &nbsp           G <br> <br>
And there's so much more <br> <br>
&nbsp  &nbspB7     &nbsp  &nbsp         Em &nbsp  &nbsp          A &nbsp  &nbsp <br> <br>
